# Ravine

Split, reversible, cheap, mx+choc+hotswap, 30% keyboard with palm key and encoder. 
Created in ergogen, whose configuration was inspired by ezxzeng's sweep_squared_rot.
Notable changes:
  - Completely modified layout (including a palm key),
  - Compatibility with a 2032 coin cell,
  - Xiao MCU,
  - Optional ec11 rotary encoders,
  - Simultaneous hotswap compatibility with chocv1, v2, and MX.


V2 planned! Working on v1's formware atm.
